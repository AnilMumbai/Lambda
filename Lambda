When you store data in Amazon S3, you can easily share it for use by multiple applications. However, each application might have unique data format requirements, and might need modification or processing of your data for a specific use case. For example, a dataset created by an ecommerce application might include personally identifiable information (PII). When the same data is processed for analytics, this PII is not needed and should be redacted. However, if the same dataset is used for a marketing campaign, you might need to enrich the data with additional details, such as information from the customer loyalty database.

With S3 Object Lambda, you can add your own code to process data retrieved from S3 before returning it to an application. Specifically, you can configure an AWS Lambda function and attach it to an S3 Object Lambda Access Point. When an application sends standard S3 GET requests through the S3 Object Lambda Access Point, the specified Lambda function is invoked to process any data retrieved from an S3 bucket through the supporting S3 access point. Then, the S3 Object Lambda Access Point returns the transformed result back to the application. You can author and execute your own custom Lambda functions, tailoring the S3 Object Lambda data transformation to your specific use case, all with no changes required to your applications.
